### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Im Daniel Husik

Software Developer | Transforming Ideas into Exceptional Code | Investor

I have always had a passion for tech. Baldwin Wallace graduate, with a core focus in biology and chemistry. After my studies I worked for a local life sciences company in quality assurance, I developed exceptional skills like critical thinking and goal achievement. I thrive on these skills and enjoy collaborating with others which ultimately led me back into tech. 

I am very organized and have a keen eye for detail. From previous employment I developed skills to meet objectives in a fast-paced environment, communicate effectively, and problem solve. I am a team player that is eager to learn new software, languages, and exceed expectations.

Outside of work, I enjoy kayaking and hiking which rejuvenates my mind and fuels my creativity. I am actively seeking a junior software development role where I can apply my passion for critical thinking. I am eager to join a company that values growth and offers opportunities for professional development. Let's connect and explore how my diverse skill set can contribute to your organization's success!
